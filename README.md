### ðŸ§  About Me

ðŸ”­ I'm just getting started in tech â€” exploring coding, how software works, and what I can build with it.  
ðŸŒ± Currently learning the basics of Python, web development, and how to think like a programmer.  
ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborating on beginner-friendly projects or anything that helps me level up.  
ðŸ¤” Still figuring things out, so Iâ€™m always open to advice or cool resources.  
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about why I got into tech, what Iâ€™m learning, or just say hi.  
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him  
âš¡ Fun fact: I havenâ€™t spent hours chasing a semicolon bug yet â€” and I donâ€™t plan to.

Thanks for visiting! I'm here to learn and build â€” one step at a time.
